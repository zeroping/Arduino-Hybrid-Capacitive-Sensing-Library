This is a quick little capacitive sensing library for Arduino. 

It can sense the capacitcance between a pin and GND using an external pull-up or pull-down resistor. The function prototype is:

    int capacitiveSense(uint8_t pullup, uint8_t pin);

It can also do a form of hybrid resistive-capactive sensing sensing touch between two pins:

    int hybridSense(uint8_t pullup, uint8_t sense, uint8_t excitation);

Both of these functions expect you to use an external pull-up or pull-down, so it _GLOBALLY_ disables the built-in pull-up resistors on the microcontroller.
